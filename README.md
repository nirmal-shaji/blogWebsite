Frontend part is done using react js and image upload part is done using cloudenary services
In backend part you have to add a .env file which specifies the mongodb connection link and port number,note that the env variable should be MONGO_CONNECTION_ID for mongodb connection and PORT variable should be set to 5000;
Please note to set the PORT to 5000(as the cors is defined to localhost:5000 in frontend)
